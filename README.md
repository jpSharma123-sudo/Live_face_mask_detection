# Face Mask Detection (CNN + OpenCV)

This project detects whether a person is wearing a mask in real-time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `dataset/with_mask/` â†’ Images of people with masks
- `dataset/without_mask/` â†’ Images of people without masks
- `cnn_model.py` â†’ Trains CNN model
- `train_model.py` â†’ Alternate training script
- `real_time_detection.py` â†’ Runs live mask detection with webcam
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Required dependencies

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will save the trained model as `mask_detector_model.h5`.

### 4. Run Real-Time Detection
```bash
python real_time_detection.py
```

Press **Q** to quit the webcam window.

## ðŸ“Š Model
- CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers
- Trained on dataset of masked & unmasked faces
- Uses Haar Cascade for face detection in real-time

## âœ… Output Example
- Shows **"Mask"** (green box) if mask is detected
- Shows **"No Mask"** (red box) if no mask is detected
